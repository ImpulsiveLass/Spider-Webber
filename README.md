With this mod installed, spider will place down fragile cobwebs while chasing a player/mob.

Fragile webs inherit most behaviors from regular cobwebs, but they do not drop items and break after a short period of time.

-By default spiders place down a fragile cobweb every 1.75s and the fragile webs expire after 5.25s. Both of these values can be changed through the config.

-This applies to any mob extending the spider class (this includes cave spiders).

-Fragile webs are only placed in air blocks.

-Spiders do not place webs outside of combat.

Requires MidnightLib for config.
